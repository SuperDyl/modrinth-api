        "body": "Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), which improves rendering performance.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n",

        "body": "## Tag game (compatible with Vanilla Tweaks)\n\nPlay tag like on Hermitcraft!\nSomeone starts as the tagger,\nwith the goal of making another player the tagger instead.\nAll they have to do is punch another player with the tag.\nThe tag is a custom name tag named \"Tag!\"\n\nOther players can recognize taggers\nbecause they will have a red name.\n\nThis pack includes configuration options to set a cooldown\nbefore the tagger can tag another player (default is 1 minute)\nand to disable announcement messages when players get tagged.\n\n## Vanilla Tweaks Compatible\n\nAfter Vanilla Tweaks announced they were no longer supporting this pack,\nI created this version as a continuation.\nThe code is entirely mine,\nbut it is setup to keep the same data and most of the same function names.\n\nIf you previously used the Vanilla Tweaks tag datapack,\nyou can update by simply using this pack instead.\nWhen you first open the world with this datapack,\nyour settings will be ported over to this datapack\nand old unused data will be deleted.\n\nJust like the Vanilla Tweaks version,\nthis pack also doesn't allow players to tag AFK players,\nif a player is marked AFK by the Vanilla Tweaks AFK Display pack.\n\n## Detect AFK Players Compatible\n\nThis pack will not allow players to tag AFK players\nfrom the Detect AFK Players datapack.\nIt should treat these players the same it treats players marked\nAFK by the Vanilla Tweaks AFK Display datapack.\n\n## Usage Guide\n\nTo add someone to the tagger's team and give them a tag,\nan admin can use the command `/execute as <playername> run function tag:become_tagger`\n\nTo make someone no longer a tagger (and take away their tag),\nan admin can use the command `/execute as <playername> run function tag:become_normal`\n\nAn admin can create a new tag at anytime by using the command `function tag:spawn_tag`\n\nAs long as a player is a tagger, they will have a red name.\nThis only works if the player isn't on another team.\nEvery 5 seconds, the game will give all taggers who aren't on a team back their red name.\n\nThe pack keeps track of how many times each player has been tagged.\nAn admin can display it under player names with the command\n`/scoreboard objectives setdisplay below_name tg_timesTagged`\nTo display times tagged in the multiplayer tab menu,\nuse the command `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay list tg_timesTagged`\n\nThese displays can each be hidden by using the commands\n`/scoreboard objectives setdisplay below_name` and\n`/scoreboard objectives setdisplay below_name` respectively.\n\nAny player can see the configuration settings by using the command,\n`/trigger tg_help`\nThis will show a menu with the current cooldown (shown in ticks, seconds, and minutes)\nand give options to change the cooldown and enable/disable tag announcements.\n\nOnly an admin can actually change these settings.\n\nTo remove the cooldown, an admin can open the help menu,\nchoose to change the cooldown, and set it to 0 ticks, seconds, or minutes.\n\nTrying to change the cooldown in the menu will copy a command to the admin's chat.\nFor example, if the admin clicks \"SECONDS\", they will have the command\n`/function tag:update_cooldown {conversion:20,cooldown:#seconds_here#}`\nTo turn off the cooldown, the admin could replace `#seconds_here#` with `0`:\n`/function tag:update_cooldown {conversion:20,cooldown:0}`\nTo instead set a cooldown of 30 seconds, they would change it to `30`:\n`/function tag:update_cooldown {conversion:20,cooldown:30}`\n\n## Changes from Vanilla Tweaks\n\nOne of the main reasons the Vanilla Tweaks listed for\ndiscontinuing this pack was how buggy the code was.\nSince I was writing the code from scratch,\nI decided to also change some things\nI felt were issues with the original pack.\n\n- A tagger taking thorns damage doesn't tag themself\n- If there are multiple taggers, they each have their own cooldown\n- Tags are only removed from the tagger who tagged another player,\n  not from any other taggers\n- Only the admin can change settings for the cooldown and tag announcements\n- When a tagger is still under cooldown, attempting to tag a player will\n  show the tagger how long they have left on their cooldown\n- A tagger cannot become a normal player by swapping/removing their team\n  - Instead, an admin must call `/execute as <player> run function tag:become_normal`\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease report any issues or change requests on the GitHub repository\n\n## License\n\nThis datapack and its files are made available under a GPLv3 license. You can freely download, edit, and share this code, but you must provide the same rights to those you share this datapack with.\n",
